colorize
========

Takes a code block given in plain text and converts it to appear as if its in an editor equipped with syntax coloring.
This applicaton is primitive and incomplete at this point still. Currently it requires the code block to have each LOC surrounded in a <span> tag, possibly also requiring some indentation. It is also coded for use with Python currently. I will implement the code to depracate the need to format you're code (LOC'S) in <span> markup shortly and also the ensure that when that requirement is depracted the indentation is also preserved. I dont see this being too much work. I will also work on implementation for languages other then Python. Thanks, check back soon.
